warning: [options] bootstrap class path is not set in conjunction with -source 8
  not setting the bootstrap class path may lead to class files that cannot run on JDK 8
    --release 8 is recommended instead of -source 8 -target 1.8 because it sets the bootstrap class path automatically
warning: [options] source value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
warning: [options] target value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
warning: [options] To suppress warnings about obsolete options, use -Xlint:-options.
