# Modularization of SocialIssuesPanel

## What Was Done

We extracted the `SocialIssuesPanel` inner class from `CandidateDetailsPanel` and turned it into a standalone component in its own Java file. This refactoring involved:

1. Creating a new file `SocialIssuesPanel.java` in the `src/frontend/admin` directory
2. Moving all the code from the inner class to this new file with minimal changes
3. Updating `CandidateDetailsPanel.java` to import and use the new external class
4. Removing the now redundant inner class definition

## Benefits of Modularization

### 1. Code Reusability
- The `SocialIssuesPanel` can now be used in multiple places throughout the application
- Can be imported by any component that needs to display or edit social issue stances
- No need to duplicate code when similar functionality is needed elsewhere

### 2. Improved Maintainability
- Changes to the social issues functionality only need to be made in one place
- Easier to test in isolation
- Reduced file size for `CandidateDetailsPanel.java` (from ~2000 lines to ~1500 lines)
- Better separation of concerns

### 3. Enhanced Collaboration
- Different team members can work on different components simultaneously
- Clear ownership of component functionality
- Easier to review changes in smaller, focused files

### 4. Simplified Future Development
- New features related to social issues can be added without modifying `CandidateDetailsPanel`
- Easier to extend with new functionality like:
  - Different visualization modes
  - Comparison views of multiple candidates' positions
  - Issue filtering or categorization

## Implementation Details

### Component Properties
- Maintains a list of social issues and stance options
- Handles its own styling and layout
- Provides public methods to access selected stance data
- Self-contained scrolling behavior

### Interface Improvements
- Clean API for integrating with parent components
- Simple constructor with just essential parameters:
  ```java
  SocialIssuesPanel(int width, Font regularFont, Font mediumFont)
  ```
- Easy to get the selected data:
  ```java
  Map<String, String> stances = socialIssuesPanel.getSelectedStances();
  ```

## Usage Example
```java
// Create the social issues panel with the appropriate width and fonts
SocialIssuesPanel issuesPanel = new SocialIssuesPanel(
    panelWidth,
    interRegular,
    interMedium
);

// Add to parent container
parentPanel.add(issuesPanel);

// Later, when saving data, get all selections
Map<String, String> candidateStances = issuesPanel.getSelectedStances();
// Process the stances as needed
```

## Future Enhancements
- Add ability to customize the list of issues
- Implement methods to pre-populate selected stances for editing existing candidates
- Add filtering or categorization of issues
- Support for issue descriptions or help text
- Option to display statistics or comparisons with average voter positions
